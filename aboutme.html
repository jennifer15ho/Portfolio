                        <p id="info">Hi, as from the title of the website, my name is Jennifer Ho. I am a senior at Skyline High School. I am interested in pursuing a job in computer
                        programming because today's society is changing where technology is becoming bigger and more involved
                        in our daily lives and I want to help be apart of the change. In my freetime, I really love to read 
                        and listen to music. Yup that's basically it. Here are some more stuff about me below</p>
